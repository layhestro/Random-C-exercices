# C Programming Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises that cover various fundamental and advanced topics, 
including string manipulation, number guessing games, matrix operations, 
and implementations of well-known algorithms like Fibonacci sequence and Pascal's triangle.

This are among the first code, I've ever written

## Among Others Things, You will find

### 1. `Chaine.c`
- Implements functions to manipulate strings, such as:
  - Checking if one string is contained within another.
  - Converting a string to uppercase (currently incomplete).
  - Removing a specified character from a string.

### 2. `findNUmberBetween1And100.c`
- A number guessing game where the user must guess a random number between 1 and 100. The user is given feedback whether their guess is too high or too low and has a maximum of 10 attempts.

### 3. `INVERSEUR.c`
- Contains a function to swap the values of two integers using pointers.

### 4. `Jeu.c`
- This file appears to be part of a larger game-related program. It likely contains some game logic or utility functions for game development in C.

### 5. `LookForSubString.c`
- Implements functionality to search for a substring within a string.

### 6. `Nombre d'or.c`
- A program related to the Golden Ratio. This file likely contains logic to compute or work with the Golden Ratio in some manner.

### 7. `produit_matriciel.c`
- Implements matrix multiplication. The program likely multiplies two matrices and outputs the result.

### 8. `suite de fibonacci.c`
- Implements the Fibonacci sequence, calculating numbers in the sequence either iteratively or recursively.

### 9. `trianglepascal.c`
- Implements Pascal's triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients.

### 10. `Vecteur.c`
- Implements operations related to vectors, likely including operations such as addition, scalar multiplication, or dot products.

Learning Outcomes

Through these exercises, I gained experience in:

Basic C Programming: Working with fundamental constructs such as loops, conditionals, functions, and pointers.
String Manipulation: Implementing functions to manipulate and search strings.
Dynamic Memory and Pointers: Understanding how to work with pointers for memory manipulation and passing data between functions.
Algorithmic Thinking: Implementing algorithms for tasks like matrix multiplication, Fibonacci sequence generation, and constructing Pascal's triangle.
